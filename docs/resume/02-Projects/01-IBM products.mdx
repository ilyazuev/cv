# Lineage for IBM products and Oracle

During my work in ING-Diba, I have implemented a system that expanded the capabilities of IBM products.

### Covered products:

- **IBM DataStage 11.7** + **IBM InfoSphere Information Governance Catalog**
- **IBM Cloud Pak for Data** + **IBM Watson Catalogue**

### Involved products:

- Oracle databases

- Atlassian Confluence

- Microsoft Azure

- Amason S3

### Lineage

I developed the lineage: complete control over all enterprise data flows.
Using ANTLR, a system was written for lexical/grammatical parsing of all ETL/ELT processes, as well as all related Oracle SQL queries (of any complexity).
The lineage includes a complete data flow graph and also a connection between the technical level and the business level.
The technical part allows a complete detailed analysis of data flows and covers both the level of tables and ETL/ELT processes, as well as fields and variables.
It is also possible to process enterprise-specific data flow connections (specific lineage cases).
The system includes a service for automatically rebuilding the graph in case of any changes in ETL/ELT processes or database structures.

Lineage GUI:

- interactive visualization of data flow graphs;

- reporting;

- statistics;

- convenient navigation between graph nodes;

- possibility of filtering the graph according to specified criteria.

## Generating/Adjusting

Parsing algorithms serve as the basis for generating new ETL/ELT processes.
It allows to generate ETL/ELT processes of almost any complexity with
taking into account data historicization algorithms, such as SCD1, SCD2, Data Vault 2.0 etc, and in a free form too.
The system includes mechanisms for batch configuration of multiple ETL/ELT processes, as well as preparation of ETL/ELT processes for deployment.

## Data quality (DQ)

The module allows to automate DQ processes:

- setting requirements for data verification;

- generation of ETL/ELT processes to check DQ;

- registration of verification rules;

- accompanying automatically creation and updating of documentation.

## Versioning

In addition, the system includes modules:

- automatic versioning of ETL/ELT processes and all database objects

- GUI for easy recovery of ETL/ELT processes

- visualization of simultaneous comparison of revisions ETL/ELT processes in human reedable form

- batch comparison of multiple ETL/ELT processes

- global search

Technically, the system is a client-server solution,
both with a direct http connection and using web sockets.

After developing the project, I transfer knowledge to the team
developers for subsequent project support.
